# Smart_Lights
This project implements a smart lighting system using an ESP32 microcontroller, allowing users to control multiple lights (LEDs or relays) through both a web server that displays the current state of each light and allows users to toggle them remotely. Physical buttons are also included for manual operation, making system flexible, user-friendly.
